Hilary Pearson

Treasurer

Hilary was a stockbroker for many years, one of the first six women to be admitted to the London Stock Exchange in 1973.  She learned about the Girls of the Realm Guild (as it was then) and was persuaded by the chairman to join the committee.  In due course her financial background made her the natural successor to the retiring treasurer. Appreciating how fortunate she was, she is very keen to help students lacking the funds for further education.  Having spent many years in London, she now lives in the country where she supports local charities such as a hospice and a group looking after Ukrainian refugees.
